(1) PYTHON :
          * Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
          * python is an interpreted and object - oriented method ,high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

(2) PYTHON USES :
               * Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
               * software development,
               * mathematics,
               * system scripting.
               * web designing
               * data analysis

(3) PYTHON COMMENTS :
                 * Comments can be used to explain Python code.
                 * Comments can be used to make the code more readable.so, understand to everyone
                 * Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code in python.
                 * comments starting to be (#).and then python will ignore .
                 * python accept multiple comments line.
                   example:
                   
               (i)        a= 5,109,5
                          print(a)        # the numbers are (int) data type   

                        ➪  the # sentences are python are ignored in the program.

                * Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.
                * it will be considerd (""" to """)

(4) VARIABLES :
             * Variables are containers for storing data values.
              example :
                         a=10        # 10 is data storing value.
                                     # a is a variable.

            * Python has no command for declaring a variable.
            * A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

(5) THE VARIABLE ARE FOLLOWING STEPS :

   The Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

(i) Casting:
    ☞︎︎︎ If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
(II) Get the Type:
    ☞︎︎︎ You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
(III) Single and double quotes:
    ☞︎︎︎ the string variables can be declared by using ('' or "").
(IV) Case-Sensitive:
      Variable names are case-sensitive.
      example: 
            a=10
            A="antho"   # the variable name are a & A is case - sensitive.

(6) VARIABLE NAME :

               * A variable name  can have a short name (like x and y) or name , place , a to z ...etc,
               * it must be any letters or underscore character...( a=10 or a_anto =5)   # a & a_anto are variable name.

(7) VARIABLES ARE IN MULTI WAYS :
                               there are different ways to variable to defined.
(I) CAMEL CASE :
                 Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
                EXAMPLE:            myVariableName = "ANTO"         # my(V)ariable(N)ame =the first letter else. all are in capital letter.

(II) PASCAL CASE :
                  Each word starts with a capital letter:
                EXAMPLE:            MyVariableName = "anto"         # (M)y(V)ariable(N)ame = the all letter in capital letter.

(III) SNAKE CASE :
                  Each word is separated by an underscore character:
                 EXAMPLE:           my_variable_name = "anto"       # the each word is separated by "_".



 (8) ASSIGN MULTIPLE VALUE :
                              Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.
                          Example: a,b,c= "anto","aravind","aakash"
                                   print(a,b,c)                     # "anto","aravind","aakash" the assign value in multiple variable.
  
there are in different ways.

(i) One Value to Multiple Variables:
                                          And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.
                                          Example:  x = y = z = "Orange"
                                                   print(x)
                                                   print(y)
                                                   print(z)                    # they are same value "orange" but the variable are diffrent.

(9) OUTPUT VARIABLES :
                    * The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
                    * The print () inside the argument values are ["+" ,"-" , "*" , "/"] whatever operator use to and to get the value. it's will be in numberic type.
                    * And to the value are in character [ "+" , ",'] are using

                    example: (i) x = "Python "
                                 y = "is "
                                 z = "awesome"
                                 print(x + y + z)          # the assign character in "+"       O/P : python is awsome

                              (ii) x = 95
                                   y = 50
                                   print(x - y)            # the assign value to separation     O/P : 45

(10) GLOBAL VARAIABLE :
                       * Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
                       * Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.           
            example: 
                    a = "awesome"                
                    def myfunc():                               # def are used to outsidefunction
                      print("The boy is " + x)
                    myfunc()                                                                 O/p : The boy is awsome.          

                       * If you create a variable with the same name inside a function python accept .
            example: 
                      x = "cute"
                      def myfunc():
                        x = "adorable"                         # In this "x" is variable , in two times in the program
                          print("the baby is " + x)
                      myfunc()
                      print("the flower is " + x)                                                 O/p : the baby is cute
                                                                                                        the flower is adorable.

(11) DATA TYPES IN PYTHON :
                            *  In programming, data type is an important concept.
                            *  Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
                            *  Python has the following data types built-in by default.
The categories are ,

         ☞︎︎︎  Text Type         :	str ( string are text type / example : a= "alex" )

         ☞︎︎︎  Numeric Types     :	int ( just numbers / example : a = 12 ), float ( numbers in points / example: a = 0.12), complex ( numbers with j / example: a = o2j ).

         ☞︎︎︎  Sequence Types    :	list ( list are define in squre bracket / example : a = ["apple"] , tuple ( tuple are defind as round bracket / example : a = ( "apple") ,  range ( range function are the function value is starting & between the function value to calculate / example : a = range 6 , o/p 0,1,2,3,4,5.

         ☞︎︎︎  Mapping Type      :	dict ( dict store data values in key ,value pairs / example a = { "name":"alex"} ) its define as {} .

         ☞︎︎︎  Set Types         :	set ( Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable / example a= { "ant", "cat" , "dog"} ) set are define {} , frozenset ( Freeze the list, and make it unchangeable  / example: a = { 'apple'}.

         ☞︎︎︎  Boolean Type      :	bool ( Booleans represent one of two values: True or False / example : a = 10 
                                                                                                           print(10)    o/p ; true.  
                     
         ☞︎︎︎  Binary Types      :	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

         ☞︎︎︎  None Type         :	NoneType


(10)  PYTHON NUMBERS :

 (i)   * there are three type in python.
                           ➪ int         ☞︎︎︎   Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length. ( example: a = 12 )
                           ➪ float       ☞︎︎︎   "Floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals  ( example: a = 12.0 )
                           ➪ complex     ☞︎︎︎    Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part.  ( example: a = 12j )

(ii) random number : 
                      * Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, 
                        but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers.
example:
         import random
          print(random.randrange(1, 10))     # the random function are choose the value in random from the list.


(11) specify a variable type (or) python casting :

                                 There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable.
there are 3 type ,
                    ➪ int()
                    ➪ float()
                    ➪ str()
