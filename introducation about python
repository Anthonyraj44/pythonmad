                                          (1) PYTHON :

          * Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
          * python is an interpreted and object - oriented method ,high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

                                      (2) PYTHON USES :

               * Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
               * software development,
               * mathematics,
               * system scripting.
               * web designing
               * data analysis

                                    (3) PYTHON COMMENTS :

                 * Comments can be used to explain Python code.
                 * Comments can be used to make the code more readable.so, understand to everyone
                 * Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code in python.
                 * comments starting to be (#).and then python will ignore .
                 * python accept multiple comments line.
                   example:
                   
               (i)        a= 5,109,5
                          print(a)        # the numbers are (int) data type



                        ➪  the # sentences are python are ignored in the program.

                * Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.
                * it will be considerd (""" to """)

                                       (4) VARIABLES :

             * Variables are containers for storing data values.
              example :
                         a=10        # 10 is data storing value.
                                     # a is a variable.

            * Python has no command for declaring a variable.
            * A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

                                (5) THE VARIABLE ARE FOLLOWING STEPS :

   The Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

(i) Casting:
    ☞︎︎︎ If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
(II) Get the Type:
    ☞︎︎︎ You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
(III) Single and double quotes:
    ☞︎︎︎ the string variables can be declared by using ('' or "").
(IV) Case-Sensitive:
      Variable names are case-sensitive.
      example: 
            a=10
            A="antho"   # the variable name are a & A is case - sensitive.

                                     (6) VARIABLE NAME :

               * A variable name  can have a short name (like x and y) or name , place , a to z ...etc,
               * it must be any letters or underscore character...( a=10 or a_anto =5)   # a & a_anto are variable name.

(7) VARIABLES ARE IN MULTI WAYS :
                               there are different ways to variable to defined.
(I) CAMEL CASE :
                 Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
                EXAMPLE:            myVariableName = "ANTO"         # my(V)ariable(N)ame =the first letter else. all are in capital letter.

(II) PASCAL CASE :
                  Each word starts with a capital letter:
                EXAMPLE:            MyVariableName = "anto"         # (M)y(V)ariable(N)ame = the all letter in capital letter.

(III) SNAKE CASE :
                  Each word is separated by an underscore character:
                 EXAMPLE:           my_variable_name = "anto"       # the each word is separated by "_".



 (8) ASSIGN MULTIPLE VALUE :
                              Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.
                          Example: a,b,c= "anto","aravind","aakash"
                                   print(a,b,c)                     # "anto","aravind","aakash" the assign value in multiple variable.
  
there are in different ways.

(i) One Value to Multiple Variables:
                                          And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.
                                          Example:  x = y = z = "Orange"
                                                   print(x)
                                                   print(y)
                                                   print(z)                    # they are same value "orange" but the variable are dif
(9) OUTPUT VARIABLES :

                    * The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
                    * The print () inside the argument values are ["+" ,"-" , "*" , "/"] whatever operator use to and to get the value. it's will be in numberic type.
                    * And to the value are in character [ "+" , ",'] are using

                    example: (i) x = "Python "
                                 y = "is "
                                 z = "awesome"
                                 print(x + y + z)          # the assign character in "+"       O/P : python is awsome

                              (ii) x = 95
                                   y = 50
                                   print(x - y)            # the assign value to separation     O/P : 45

(10) GLOBAL VARAIABLE :
                       * Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
                       * Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.           
            example: 
                    a = "awesome"                
                    def myfunc():                               # def are used to outsidefunction
                      print("The boy is " + x)
                    myfunc()                                                                 O/p : The boy is awsome.          

                       * If you create a variable with the same name inside a function python accept .
            example: 
                      x = "cute"
                      def myfunc():
                        x = "adorable"                         # In this "x" is variable , in two times in the program
                          print("the baby is " + x)
                      myfunc()
                      print("the flower is " + x)                                                 O/p : the baby is cute
                                                                                                        the flower is adorable.

                                (11) DATA TYPES IN PYTHON :

                            *  In programming, data type is an important concept.
                            *  Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
                            *  Python has the following data types built-in by default.
The categories are ,

         ☞︎︎︎  Text Type         :	str ( string are text type / example : a= "alex" )

         ☞︎︎︎  Numeric Types     :	int ( just numbers / example : a = 12 ), float ( numbers in points / example: a = 0.12), complex ( numbers with j / example: a = o2j ).

         ☞︎︎︎  Sequence Types    :	list ( list are define in squre bracket / example : a = ["apple"] , tuple ( tuple are defind as round bracket / example : a = ( "apple") ,  range ( range function are the function value is starting & between the function value to calculate / example : a = range 6 , o/p 0,1,2,3,4,5.

         ☞︎︎︎  Mapping Type      :	dict ( dict store data values in key ,value pairs / example a = { "name":"alex"} ) its define as {} .

         ☞︎︎︎  Set Types         :	set ( Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable / example a= { "ant", "cat" , "dog"} ) set are define {} , frozenset ( Freeze the list, and make it unchangeable  / example: a = { 'apple'}.

         ☞︎︎︎  Boolean Type      :	bool ( Booleans represent one of two values: True or False / example : a = 10 
                                                                                                           print(10) )   o/p ; true.  
                     
         ☞︎︎︎  Binary Types      :	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

         ☞︎︎︎  None Type         :	NoneType


                                        (10)  PYTHON NUMBERS :

 (i)   * there are three type in python.
                           ➪ int         ☞︎︎︎    Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length. ( example: a = 12 )
                           ➪ float       ☞︎︎︎   "Floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals  ( example: a = 12.0 )
                           ➪ complex     ☞︎︎︎    Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part.  ( example: a = 12j )

(ii) random number : 
                      * Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, 
                        but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers.
example:
         import random
          print(random.randrange(1, 10))     # the random function are choose the value in random from the list.


                             (11) specify a variable type (or) python casting :

                                 There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable.
there are 3 type ,
                    ➪ int()
                    ➪ float()
                    ➪ str()

                                          (12) PYHTON STRINGS :

   * Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
   * 'hello' is the same as "hello".

example: 
       a= "heiii"
       print(a)         O/p: heii

   * You can display a string literal with the print() function.
   * string can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes (""" , """) or three single quotes (''' , ''').

example: 
          a=""" hello everybody this is alex from chennai."""
          print(a)                                            O/p : hello everybody this is alex from chennai.

(i) SLICING STRING :
                *  slicing string are you can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
example:
          a=" hiii alex"
          print (a.[1:3])        O/p: iii

                * SLICE FROM THE START : By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character

                             exampe:    a="hiii alex"  
                                        print (a.[:3])      O/p: hiii
                
                * SLICE TO THE END : By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end.

                              example:    a="hiii alex"
                                          print(a.[2:])      O/p : ii alex

                * NEGATIVE INDEXING : Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string.

                              exampe :    a="hiii alex"
                                          print (a.[-3:-1])     O/p: lex

(ii) MODIFY STRING :

                * UPPER CASE : The upper() method returns the string in upper case ( all letter are capitel letter)

                         example:  a="hiii alex"
                                  print(a.upper())         O/p: HIII ALEX

                * LOWER CASE : The lower() method returns the string in lower case ( all letter are small letter).

                         example:   a=("HIII ALEX")
                                    print(a.lower())         O/p: hiii alex

                * REMOVE WHITESPACE : The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end.

                         example:   a=("   hiii  alex  ")
                                    print(a.strip())               O/p: hiii alex       # the space are removed.

                * REPLACE STRING : The replace() method replaces a string with another string.

                         example:  a=(" aiii alex") 
                                   print(a.replace("a","h"))        O/p : hiii alex

                * SPLIT STRING : The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items. split the value to another another.
 
                         example:  a="hello,alex" 
                                   print(a.split.())      # 'hello','alex'
 
(iii) STRING CONCATENATION : 
                    To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the ( + ) operator.
    example :
            a,b into c ?
                            a= "Hiii"
                            b= "Alex"
                            c=a+b
                            print(c)     # O/p : Hiii Alex
(iv) format string :
                   *  the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this.  
                   *  But we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method  .
                   * {} there are replace the value in format string
 example :
           age = 22                                    # insert the number into string.
           txt = "My name is alex , and I am {}"
           print(txt.format(age))                       # O/p: My name is alex , and I am 22 

(v) ESCAPE CHARACTERS IN STRING :
                             * To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character
                             * An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
  example:
          txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."       # there are double quotes invold in 3 , the specify word are mention using \  \.
                       O/p : error.

ESCAPE CHARACTERS ;

            1 .     \'	   Single Quote	  ➪   python to write the string normal , example : it is to change it's . (\') this format used.

            2.      \\	   Backslash	  ➪   txt= "This will insert one \\ (backslash)." to  O/P : " This will insert one \ (backslash).

            3.      \n	   New Line	  ➪   txt = "Hello\nWorld!" to   O/P :  Hello
                                                                                      World!	

            4.      \r	   Carriage Return  ➪   txt = "Hello\rWorld!  to  O/P :  Hello
                                                                                     World!

            5.      \t	   Tab	           ➪   txt = "Hello\tWorld!"  to  O/P : Hello  World       # both letter between spaced.

            6.      \b	   Backspace	  ➪   txt = "Hello \bWorld!" to  O/P : HelloWorld         # both letter between space removed

            7.      \f        Form Feed	  ➪

            8.      \ooo      Octal value	  ➪   txt = "\110\145\154\154\157"   to    O/P : Hello 

            9.      \xhh      Hex value        ➪   txt = "\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f"   to   O/P : Hello


                                       (11) PYTHON BOOLEANS 

    * Booleans represent one of two values: (True) or (False) .
    * The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return.

Example :  (i)                                                                 (ii)

                            (13) PYTHON LIST

   * Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable .
   * Lists are created using square brackets [] .
   * List items are , * ordered * changeable * allow all dublicate value. 
Examble :
        thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]      # two apple are in the list .

   * LIST LENGTH : To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function .
Example : 
           thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
           print(len(thislist))                              # O/p : 3

   * List items can be of any data type ( string , int , boolen )
   * From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list' .....< class.type>

(1) ACCESS LIST :
           
       * ACCESS ITEMS : you can access them by referring to the index number . example :     thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                                                                                             print(thislist[1])        O/p : banana 

       * NEGATIVE INDEXING : Negative indexing means start from the end . (-1 refers to the last item). example :   thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                                                                                                                    print(thislist[-1])    O/p : cherry 

       * RANGE OF INDEXING : The specifying where to start and where to end the range .the return value will be a new list with the specified items.
                       example :   thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
                                   print(thislist[2:5])           O/p : [ "cherry", "orange", "kiwi" ]
       *    it also [-5:-1]  type mode use.

(2) CHANGE LIST ITEMS : 
                      *    To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number .
 example : 
            thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
            print(thislist)                              #O/p : ["apple", "blackcurrant", "cherry"]
 
              
                     * To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.

(3)  ADD LIST ITEMS : To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method . Example : thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                                                                                                 thislist.append("orange")
                                                                                                 print(thislist)                   O/p :["orange","apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
* INSERT ITEMS : To insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.
* EXTEND LIST : To append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.
 
(4) REMOVE ITEMS : 
                    The remove() method removes the specified item.
 Example : 
            thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            thislist.remove("banana")
            print(thislist)               O/p : ["apple", "cherry"]
                  
  * REMOVE SPECIFIED INDEX : The pop() method removes the specified index . The del keyword also removes the specified index .
  * CLEAR THE LIST : The clear() method empties the list. The list still remains, but it has no content.
  * LOOP LIST : You can loop through the list items by using a ( for loop ) . You can loop through the list items by using a ( while loop ).

(5) SORT LIST : List objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default .

              Example :    thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
                           thislist.sort()
                           print(thislist)            # O/p :  ['banana', 'kiwi', 'mango', 'orange', 'pineapple'] ....the list are alphabaticly arranged.
 *  REVERSE ORDER : The reverse() method reverses the current sorting order of the elements , to reverse the order of a list, regardless of the alphabet .

(6)  COPY LIST : You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, 
                 and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.

(7) LIST JOIN :     *  There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python.
                       One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator .
                    *  Or you can use the extend() method .

Example : 
          a = 33
          b = 33
            if b > a:
         print("b is greater than a")
           elif a == b:
         print("a and b are equal")       # O/p: a and b are equal

* ELSE STATEMENT :
              The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
Example : 
          a = 200
          b = 33
            if b > a:
          print("b is greater than a")
            elif a == b:
          print("a and b are equal")
            else:
          print("a is greater than b")       # O/p : a is greater then b

* 

STATEMENT              DISTRACTION                                            EXAMPLE 

    AND              and keyword is a logical operator, 
                     and is used to combine conditional statements:            a = 200                # o/P : Both condition are true  
                                                                               b = 33

    OR              or keyword is a logical operator, 
                   and is used to combine conditional statements                    a = 200
                                                                                    b = 33             # O/p : At least one of the conditions is True.

    NOT          not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to 
                 reverse the result of the conditional statement:                   a = 33
                                                                                    b = 200            # O/p : a is NOT greater than b

                         (17) PYTHON LOOPS 

     Python has two primitive loop commands:

                                   ➪  while loops
                                   ➪  for loops

                         (18) WHILE LOOP : 

           the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
 Example : 
           i = 1                         # O/p : 1
          while i < 6:                           2
             print(i)                            3
          i += 1                                 4
                                                 5

*  THE CONTINUE STATEMENT : 
                               the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.
Example : 
           i = 0                   # O/p : 0
           while i < 6:                    1
            i += 1                         2
           if i == 3:                      4
             continue                      5
           print(i)                        6

* THE BREAK STATEMENT :   
                        the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true .
Example : 
            i = 1                   # O/p :   1
            while i < 6:                      2
              print(i)                        3
              if i == 3:
                break
              i += 1

*  THE ELSE STATEMENT :
                           the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.
Example :
            i = 1                                 # O/p :  1
          while  i < 6:                                    2
            print (i)                                      3
          i+=1                                             4
          else :                                           5
             print( " i is no longer less than 6")         i is no longer less than 6



                               (19)  FOR LOOP

* A (for) loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string) .
* (for) keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found 
  in other object-orientated programming languages.
* (for) loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc..
* The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

      Example : 

             fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]             # O/p :   apple
              for x in fruits:                                            banana
                print(x)                                                  cherry


 *  THE BREAK STATEMENT : 

        *  the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items .

Example : 

        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]         # O/p :  apple
        for x in fruits:                                        banana
          print(x)
          if x == "banana":
            break

*  THE CONTINUE STATEMENT :
                          * the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next.

Example : 
              fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]        # O/p :  apple
              for x in fruits:                                       cherry
                if x == "banana":
                  continue
                print(x)

* THE RANGE () FUNCTION : 

           * To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function .
           * The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default ,  and ends at a specified number.
(1) Example : 
          for x in range(6):       # O/p : 0                         (2) Example :    for x in range(2, 30, 3):        O/p : 2 to 30 * values , 2 are defult 
             print(x)                      1                                           print(x) 
                                           2
                                           3
                                           4
                                           5
           # that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5 .



* THE PASS STATEMENT : 
                        * for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a 
                          for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

Example : 

            for x in [0, 1, 2]:          # O/p : having an empty for loop like this, would raise an error without the pass statement .
            pass



                            (19)  PYTHON FUNCTIONS 

    * A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    * You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
    * A function can return data as a result.
    * Python a function is defined using the (def) keyword.
    * A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
      An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
    * KEYWORD ARGUEMENT : You can also send arguments with the ( key = value syntax. )
                          This way the order of the arguments does not matter.
    * If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value example : def my_function(country = "Norway"):
    * To let a function return a value, use the return statement.

Example : 
          def my_function():
          print("Hello from a function")           # my_function is calling function .



                           (20)  PYTHON LAMBDA 

 * A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
 * A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
 * lambda arguments : expression.
 * Lambda functions can take any number of arguments.

Example : 
           x = lambda a, b : a * b          # O/p : 30
           print(x(5, 6))


                         (21) PYTHON ARRAYS

* Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but (Python Lists)can be used instead.
* Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable.
* An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

Example :
              cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]        # O/p : ['Toyota', 'Volvo', 'BMW']
              cars[0] = "Toyota"
              print(cars)

ARRAY METHODS :

     
                Method	                     Description

             1. append()	     Adds an element at the end of the list.

             2. clear()	       Removes all the elements from the list.

             3. copy()	       Returns a copy of the list.

             4. count()	       Returns the number of elements with the specified value.

             5. extend()	     Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list.

             6. index()	       Returns the index of the first element with the specified value.

             7. insert()       Adds an element at the specified position.

             8. pop()	         Removes the element at the specified position.

             9. remove()	     Removes the first item with the specified value.

             10. reverse()	   Reverses the order of the list.

             11. sort()	       Sorts the list.
